This enhanced Go script is designed to process a list of domain names from an input file (input.txt), prefixing them with "http://" and "https://" to form URLs, and then saving these URLs to an output file (output.txt). For each URL, the script performs HTTP GET requests to fetch the webpage's source code and headers. If the server responds with a redirect status, the script follows the redirection to the new location and retrieves the content from there. Each fetched webpage's source code and headers are stored in a unique directory named after the URL, facilitating organized storage and easy retrieval. This tool is useful for batch processing multiple URLs to collect and analyze web content and response headers, providing insights into the web resources associated with the provided domain names.
